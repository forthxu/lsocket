lsocket - simple and easy socket support for lua

### What is it?

lsocket is a library to provide socket programming support for lua. It is not intended to be a complete socket api, but easy to use and good enough for most tasks. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported, as are tcp and udp, and also IPv4 broadcasts and IPv6 multicasts. Also, lsocket is almost nonblocking, meaning that nothing blocks except for nameserver lookups.

### What's new in version 1.1

lsocket.connect() is now also nonblocking, apart from nameserver lookups.
socket:status() method added to query sockets for errors (necessary because of non-blocking connect(), but also handy for other situations)
nicer SIGPIPE handling, using socket or send options where possible, and disabling SIGPIPE for the send/sendto operation only where options are not available.
the included rshttpd.lua example httpd library now supports keepalive connections.
### What's new in version 1.0.2

just 2 more examples, one http client and one http server, to illustrate the hoops you have to jump through in order to take advantage of the non-blocking nature of lsocket.
### What's new in version 1.0.1

enhance check of whether a nslookup is needed, should now cover all cases
modified select() to ignore closed sockets, also calling select() without open sockets and without timeout is now an error (instead of blocking forever).
added constant _VERSION, which contains the full version number for lsocket.
fixed an issue that would keep the Mac's from compiling this
some cleanup in the 5.1/5.2 compatibility department as suggested by lhf
